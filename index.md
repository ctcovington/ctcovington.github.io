### About Me 
I am a fourth-year PhD student in Biostatistics at Harvard University advised by [Jeff Miller](https://jwmi.github.io).
I am interested primarily in issues related to model misspecification and
representing uncertainty due to model selection/specification.

I spent my first two years of college at the Eastman School of Music studying percussion performance. I then transferred to Cornell University and graduated in 2016 with B.A. in Statistical Science. After graduating, I worked for a few years in various capacities doing computational research in social science, medicine, and biology before getting my introduction to data privacy as a research fellow with the [Harvard University Privacy Tools Project](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/). 
From 2020-2022, I was a student in the MMath Computer Science program at the University of Waterloo where I was advised by [Xi He](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~xihe/) and [Gautam Kamath](http://www.gautamkamath.com/).
